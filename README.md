# CSE475-Final-Project-ANN-model-on-Heart-Failure-Prediction


## Overview:

This prepository presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach to predict heart failure events using a clinical dataset consisting of 11 features. 
The project follows a structured machine learning workflow, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development and evaluation, analysis on model performance, outline for model deployment and ethical considerations.
The goal is not only achieve predictive performance, but also to assess the model behavior, capability and ethical implications in a real life healthcare context.
